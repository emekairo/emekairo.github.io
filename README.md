Curious why I decided to create CoreUI? Please read this article: [Jack of all trades, master of none. Why Bootstrap Admins Templates suck.](https://medium.com/@lukaszholeczek/jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none-5ea53ef8a1f#.7eqx1bcd8)

CoreUI is an Open Source Bootstrap Admins Template. But CoreUI is not just another Admins Template. It goes way beyond hitherto Admins templates thanks to transparent code and file structure. And if that's not enough, let’s just add that CoreUI consists bunch of unique features and over 1000 high quality icons.

CoreUI offers 6 versions: [Bootstrap](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-bootstrap-Admins-template), [Angular](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-angular-Admins-template), [Laravel](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-laravel-Admins-template), [React.js](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-react-Admins-template), [Vue.js](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-vue-Admins-template), and [Vue.js + Laravel](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-vue-laravel-Admins-template).

CoreUI is meant to be the UX game changer. Pure & transparent code is devoid of redundant components, so the app is light enough to offer ultimate user experience. This means mobile devices also, where the navigation is just as easy and intuitive as on a desktop or laptop. The CoreUI Layout API lets you customize your project for almost any device – be it Mobile, Web or WebApp – CoreUI covers them all!

There is only one limitation you can't can’t re-distribute the CoreUI as stock. You can’t do this if you modify the CoreUI. In past we faced some problems with persons who tried to sell CoreUI based templates.

## Support CoreUI Development

CoreUI is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing.
